            <h2>Composing Digital Media (CDM) Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I took the class Composing Digital Media at Pitt in the Fall 23-24 semester. You can view a couple of
                the projects I worked on here! I enjoyed learning how to (further) use Adobe products while creating
                these projects.

            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>This project asks you to advocate for a cause through the juxtaposition of images and text. You will
                create 2 advocacy posters on the same topic. <span id="ellipse1">...</span><span id="moreText1">You could be making a social commentary, raising public
                awareness about a social issue, and/or calling for action. Whatever you choose, you should consider your
                audience and what they would find persuasive or interesting, and how you therefore wish to attract and
                direct their attention.</span>

            <h3>Artist’s Statement</h3>
            <p>
                My advocacy posters focused on informing new and future cat owners of the importance of getting your cat spayed/neutered. My first
                poster is meant to look simpler with the cat head being the focus of the whole page. <span id="ellipse2">...</span><span id="moreText2">
                The collage of cats is utilized to attract the audience’s attention. This poster is supposed to be read and looked at quickly, hence 
                why there is such limited text. The second poster is meant to be more informative with added facts to expand on the general point of 
                each message. Unlike the first poster, this one is meant to be read thoroughly. There were two key messages I planned to communicate 
                through my posters. The first point was spaying/neutering can extend your cat’s life and eliminate some future problems, especially 
                diseases dealing with the reproductive system. The second point was that spaying and neutering your cat fights pet overpopulation. 
                Many cats cannot find homes because of cat overpopulation, and some are euthanized as a result.</span>

            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>You will create a 2-3 min informative video that demonstrates a concept of your choice. Your purpose is to inform the audiences and deepen 
                their awareness of the concept. <span id="ellipse3">...</span><span id="moreText3">You will include a title screen at some point during your video and include any combination of found and/or 
                original footage throughout the video. Your video should demonstrate experimentation with multitrack video editing, accompanied by your own 
                voice and a polished sound track.</span>

            <h3>Artist’s Statement</h3>
            <p>The topic of my video was AI and the Art World. Generally, I wanted to briefly overview how AI and art intersect and what affordances do they 
                give to artists. <span id="ellipse4">...</span><span id="moreText4">The first key message was how art reflects our society and that utilizing AI in the artmaking process shows how we have 
                advanced as a society. I’d say the other key message I intended to portray through my video was to make the audience think about the ethical 
                issues with creating AI-generated art. The overall point of the video was that AI use in artmaking is very nuanced because it is a new topic 
                with many viewpoints but using it is also not completely negative. Artists should always keep in mind the issues because those problems, especially 
                dealing with ownership and bias, affect real people in the world.</span>
