            <p style="max-width: 50%;">I’m a student at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in Computer Science 
            with a minor in Studio Arts and related area in Psycholgy. <br><br> I chose to major in CS after taking an
            intoduction class as a requirement for the Psych major. I really enjoyed learning about all the fascinating
            things you could do with coding. Throughout my life, I have also enjoyed messing around with my computer as 
            a result of testing out many digital drawing programs. As I have taken more advanced CS classes, I have come
            to enjoy the debugging process and coming up with different solutions. <br>
            <br>
            I have been drawing and interested in art my 
            entire life. I have experience with a plethora of digital drawing software, 
            as I started drawing digitally at a young age. I also dabbled with video 
            editing back then when I made time-lapse videos of my drawing process. 
            I feel that art and design is an essential part of who I am, and plays a role 
            in the way I think about the world. <br>
            <br>
            I’d describe my design style as “things that I like”. This mindset compels me
            to understand the requests and desires of the client. I'd like to make their ideal
            design a reality. I've taken a few psychology classes for my related area in 
            psycholgy to understand what stands out to the human brain the most.</p></div>
